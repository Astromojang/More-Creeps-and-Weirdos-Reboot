BETA 0.4
Added Medicine, With working crafting recipe; the first item craftable without cheats!
Mummy will spawn in cave, but its a little random. Turns out the only way to add non-random cave spawn is to make it only spawn in caves, and we can't have that...
Welcome Item has a new icon.
Added CHANGELOG.txt

BETA 0.3
Added:
Mummy, which was also the first mob in More Creeps And Weirdos Original. Also, now I know how to make mobs, so there will be more added faster. Known problems: Mummies don't spawn in caves; Mummies don't burn in daytime due to AI problems. Spawn in places with sand and drop wool (0-2), sand(0-2), sandstone(0-2), and Band-Aids(0-6)

Fixed: [Closes Ticket #1 by RickWeek84]
Sounds are all low pitched - My bad!
No Donut sound. - Didn't know there was one :P
The Blorp Cola and Band-Aid must be a stack of 24 and not 64 - Easy fix! (Thank goodness...)
When you right-click on the battery you should take half a heart and play a sound. - Fixed because I don't know (I just recompiled it and bingo, it was fixed... wtf?)
